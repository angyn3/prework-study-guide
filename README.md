# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation to take this coding program was for me to further advance myself in the IT industry. Going into this program, I knew that it was going to be challenging because I don't have any previous background in coding. I built this project due to it being a prework assignment PLUS it was something new for me to dip my feet into to see how everything works. I ran into multiple issues when trying to complete this project mainly because there were so many things that weren't working and a lot of self doubting. I definitely learned a lot but I look forward to learning even more once the program starts!

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
